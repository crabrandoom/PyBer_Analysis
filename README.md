On average, Rural areas offer the most profitable rides for drivers.


## Summary

In order to increase profitability, it would be in the company's interest to greatly reduce the number of drivers in the urban areas. This would create a lower supply of drivers drivers and increase the costs of individual fares. Another option would be add a surcharge for urban fares to increase the average cost.  Decreasing prices of rural rides might also increase the amount of people who take them.
